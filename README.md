# Getting Started with Create React Index

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Index](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run predeploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

The command gh-pages -d build is used to deploy a web application or a static site to GitHub Pages from a specific folder, in this case, the build folder. The gh-pages is an npm package that simplifies the process of deploying to GitHub Pages. The -d build option specifies the directory that contains the files you want to deploy. So, this command publishes the contents of the build directory to GitHub Pages.
